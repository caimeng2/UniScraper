\\n\\n\\x0cMSU Catalog Description  \\nThe many aspects of our built and natural environment—buildings, facilities, interior spaces, infrastructure, \\nneighborhoods, and communities—are an integral part of our society. Every new space and structure serves to \\ndefine and shape a community’s personality. Poor planning, design and/or construction can compromise a \\ncommunity’s appearance and drain its resources. Conversely, well-planned, designed and constructed \\nenvironments sustain and enrich a community.  \\n\\nThe Doctor of Philosophy in Planning, Design, and Construction prepares students for academic, private sector, and \\ngovernment positions within the concentrations of Construction Management, Environmental Design, or Urban \\nand Regional Planning.  Graduates of this program will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to understand \\nthe effects of plans, regulations, design, materials, project management techniques, and construction systems on \\nthe economic, environmental, and social concerns of stakeholders and society.   \\n\\nGeneral PhD Program Requirements \\nIntroduction to SPDC \\nThe School of Planning, Design and Construction (SPDC), jointly administered by the College of Agriculture and \\nNatural Resources and the College of Social Science, is composed of four major disciplines:  \\n\\nConstruction Management; \\nInterior Design; \\nLandscape Architecture; \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n•  Urban & Regional Planning. \\n \\n\\no  Construction Management; \\no  Environmental Design; \\no  Urban and Regional Planning. \\n\\nThrough the College of Agricultural and Natural Resources the School offers graduate programs leading to:  \\n\\n•  Master of Science in Construction Management; \\n•  Master of Arts in Environment Design; \\n•  Doctor of Philosophy in Planning, Design and Construction with transcriptable concentrations in: \\n\\nThrough the College of Social Science the School offers graduate programs leading to:  \\n\\n•  Masters in Urban & Regional Planning. \\n \\n\\nThe graduate student population of the school is characterized by diversity. There is a substantial representation of \\ndomestic and international students from a variety of countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Many \\nstudents, both domestic and international, have completed undergraduate degrees in Construction Management, \\nInterior Design, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Planning or degrees in related disciplines.  \\n\\nApplicants should communicate with the doctoral faculty in their desired concentration to identify a good match for \\nthem based on their and faculty’s research interests. If no Major Professor is identified in advance, the application \\nwill be circulated among the doctoral faculty in the desired concentration to identify a Major Professor. No applicant \\nwill be admitted unless an approved faculty member is willing to sponsor their application. A list of approved faculty \\nmay be found in the section specific to their degree of this handbook or on the SPDC webpage. (This information is \\nimportant in reading this document.) \\n \\nFacilities for advanced study and research are located on the top three floors of the Human Ecology Building, \\nwhich is immediately East of the MSU Student Union. These facilities include multiple studio and computer \\nlaboratories, state of the art lecture halls, faculty offices, workrooms, and dedicated graduate student research \\nand office space. Galleries for temporary displays and critique-presentations are located on two floors of the \\nbuilding. \\n\\n \\n\\n6 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cGeneral Requirements \\nAll on campus graduate students are expected to attend the School of Planning, Design and Construction’s new \\ngraduate orientation that’s held at the beginning of your first fall semester. The orientation will include an \\noverview of the graduate degrees as well as school policies and procedures. Most importantly we want to \\nfamiliarize students with the school and provide an opportunity for them to meet their fellow graduate students. \\nDuring orientation students will also be introduced to the graduate faculty within SPDC. The faculty will give an \\noverview of their research interests and activities, as well as any special research opportunities that currently exist. \\nThe orientation session should help students develop a plan for their program and identify potential members for \\ntheir Guidance Committee.  \\n\\nChanges in the Doctoral Major Professor \\nMajor Professors/Committee Chairs for PhD students in Planning, Design, and Construction are determined at \\nadmission.  Students are expected to stay with their Major Professor from start to finish of their doctoral program. \\nAt any time, if the student has concerns about the treatment by the Major Professor, he or she can meet with the \\nAssociate Director.  \\n\\nChanges in Major Professor require the agreement by the existing Major Professor, the new Major Professor, and \\nthe Associate Director.  If all involved agree to the change, student must draft a letter with the request, including \\nany applicable funding source considerations, and submit it to SPDC.  If there is not agreement among the involved \\nfaculty, the Associate Director will work to come to an equitable solution.  If the Associate Director is one of the \\nfaculty involved in the changes, then the Director will decide.  If both the Associate Director and Director are \\ninvolved in the changes, a designated alternative administrator will be selected. \\n\\nPlease note, changes in Major Professor may entail completion of additional required coursework.  Students may \\nbe required to retake their comprehensive exams if there is a change to their Chair. \\n\\nIn rare cases, when a student needs to request a change, the following guidelines must be followed: \\n\\n•  During the first semester, the student can request a change by submitting a written request with \\n\\njustification to the Associate Director of the program. If the student was funded by the doctoral Major \\nProfessor, he or she will need to sign off that the work expected under the funding has been completed.  \\n•  After the first semester, the student will only be allowed to change the Major Professor if he or she makes \\na case for a substantial change in the research area that aligns with another faculty member by submitting \\na written request with justification to the Associate Director of the program. If the student was funded by \\nthe Major Professor, he or she will need to sign off that the work expected under the funding has been \\ncompleted. \\n\\n \\nFormation of Guidance Committee \\n\\n• \\n\\nThe Guidance Committee shall be formed no later than the third semester of doctoral study, or within \\ntwo semesters beyond the master’s degree or its equivalent. \\n\\n•  By the end of the second semester, a Guidance Committee is selected by the student with advice from the \\n\\nMajor Professor. \\n\\n•  Within one semester after the committee has met, the Major Professor shall file a Guidance Committee \\n\\nreport with the Dean of the College, listing all degree requirements. \\n \\n\\nMembers of the committee act as mentors, advisors, and evaluators for the student’s program and research. They \\nrecommend the course plan and conduct the comprehensive examination, the dissertation proposal, and the final \\ndefense. All committee members are regular faculty of MSU or specialists that have been approved by the \\nGraduate School to serve on doctoral Guidance Committees.  \\n\\nThe Guidance Committee should be comprised of a minimum of four faculty members including the doctoral Major \\nProfessor who will serve as the committee chairperson. The chairperson and one other committee member should \\n\\n \\n\\n7 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cbe from the student’s area of concentration within the school, a third member can be from the student’s area of \\nconcentration or another area of concentration within the school, and a fourth member must be from outside the \\nschool. \\n\\nChanges in the Guidance Committee Members \\nStudents are expected to stay with their Guidance Committee from start to finish of their program.  If a student \\nneeds to make a change to their committee membership, they should discuss the changes with their Major \\nProfessor and draft a request to the Associate Director requesting the change and the reasons behind the change.  \\nIf the Associate Director is involved in the change, the request should be addressed to the Director. \\n\\nIn rare cases, when a student needs to request a change, the following guidelines must be followed: \\n\\n•  Any change in the Guidance Committee must have a written request from the Major Professor with \\n\\njustification to the Associate Director of the program. The acceptable justifications include: \\n\\nSubstantial change in the research area; \\n\\no \\no  Unavailability of the member. \\n\\n \\nChanges in Grades \\nThe Following changes are not permitted in the PhD degree plan: \\n\\n•  Adding or deleting a course for which a grade has already been assigned under any of the three grading \\n\\nsystems (numerical, pass-no grade, or credit- no-credit). \\n\\n•  Adding or deleting a course for which grading was postponed by the use of DF- deferred or I- incomplete \\n\\n•  Adding or deleting a course with the student dropped after the middle of the semester and for which “W” \\n\\nmarker. \\n\\nor “N” or “0.0” was designated. \\n\\n \\nApproval of the PhD Degree Plan \\nBy the end of the first academic year, all PhD students must complete a degree plan in Grad Plan. The plan must be \\napproved by the Major Professor and the Guidance Committee. Once submitted, any and all changes to the plan \\nmust be made with recommendation from the student’s Major Professor and the Guidance Committee. The \\nsubject matter and instructor must be specified for every independent study, special problems, or selected topics \\ncourse that is included in the student’s program.  \\n\\nThe degree plan and any subsequent changes must be approved by the Associate Director and the College \\nAssociate Dean. It is strongly suggested that all PhD students map out their coursework and requirements early as \\nmany courses are taught only one semester per year and others may have prerequisites. \\n\\nDoctoral Required Course Credits \\nThe Student must complete 9 credits in the following courses: \\n\\nPDC 901: Integrated Approach to Planning, Design and Construction (3 credits); \\nPDC 992: Advanced Research Methods in Planning, Design and Construction (3 credits); \\n\\n• \\n• \\n•  An advanced statistics course or other related course (3 credits); \\n\\n \\nComplete a minimum of 4 additional elective courses related to the area of concentration as specified (12 \\ncredits); \\nPDC 999: Dissertation Research (24 credits). \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n \\nEach student working toward a Doctor of Philosophy degree must conduct original research upon which a \\ndissertation which makes a significant contribution to knowledge is to be prepared and published. The research is \\nto be under the direction of and acceptable to the guidance committee. Twenty-Four (24) dissertation credits are \\n\\n \\n\\n8 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0crequired for graduation; students can enroll for a maximum of 36 credits. Requests for overrides to exceed the \\nmaximum of 36 credits of 999 must be directed to the Office of the Register. To do so, access the “Request for RNR \\nOverride” form online at the Office of the Registrar Online Forms Menu. Should the total of number of credits go \\nabove 45, the RO will confer with the Graduate School before considering the request for an exception. \\n\\nDoctoral Degree Components \\nAll Doctoral students engage in a combination of formal coursework as well as independent efforts that result in a \\nThesis. THE SPDC PhD degree programs are structured around the following components: \\n\\nCore courses; \\nElective courses; \\n\\n• \\n• \\n•  Research component. \\n\\nTransfer Courses \\nStudents may transfer no more than 9 approved semester credits of course work, excluding research and \\nDissertation credits.  Credits transferred are established through the Program of Study as agreed upon by the \\nstudent’s committee.  Credits must be verified through official transcripts.  Transferred credits must have been \\ngraduate level courses and earned at a 3.0 or above, or equivalent as determined by chair (if not on a 4.0 scale), to \\nbe included.   \\n\\nWritten and Oral Comprehensive Examination  \\nAt the end of the semester in which they will complete their required coursework, students will be eligible to take \\na comprehensive examination covering the major and related fields. At least one component of the comprehensive \\nexamination must be written and must be maintained in the department for three years. Students must be \\nenrolled in a minimum of 1 credit during the semester in which they take comprehensive examinations (current \\nsemester enrollment covers student until the day before classes start for the following semester).  \\n\\nA passing evaluation must be given by 2/3 of committee members in order for student to pass.  Students who fail \\nthe initial evaluation will work with their Chair and committee members for guidance on how to improve and may \\nbe re-evaluated the following semester.  The student must meet the minimum enrollment requirement for the \\nUniversity during this additional semester.  Students who fail a second attempt will be dismissed from the \\nprogram. \\n\\nThe comprehensive examination must be completed before the dissertation proposal defense can be scheduled. \\nAny change in the Major Professor after passing the comprehensive examination may require retaking and passing \\nthe comprehensive examination. The comprehensive examination must be passed within five years of starting the \\ndegree. All remaining requirements for the degree must be completed within eight years from the time a student \\nenrolls into their first class at MSU that appears on his or her doctoral program. Request for extensions beyond the \\neight year period must be submitted by the School for approval to the Dean of the College and the Dean of the \\nGraduate School. \\n\\n \\n\\nIndependent Study  \\nAt Michigan State University an independent study is a planned study that is highly individualized and not \\naddressable through any other course format. In essence, a student must design a full course for his or her \\nprogram with the help of a faculty member. \\n\\nStudents electing to undertake an independent study must select a faculty member who agrees to supervise the \\nproject. The student must complete and submit an Application for Independent Study to the Major Professor for \\napproval. The application should then be submitted to the Graduate Secretary to obtain the Associate Director’s \\n\\n \\n\\n9 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0capproval. Once this has been completed, an override will be issued and the student may register for the course \\nand the number of credits agreed upon. \\n\\nThe independent study must: \\n\\n \\n\\nConsist of work not described in the MSU description of courses book in any other format. \\n\\n• \\n•  Relate to a subject for which the student has adequate preparation. \\n•  Be directed by a faculty member with whom they have periodic contact with throughout the study. \\n•  Not exceed a maximum of 4 credits of independent study per semester or 8 credits in a single academic \\n\\nyear, subject to the School, College and Graduate School restrictions. \\n\\n•  Be applied for on the application for independent study form. \\n•  Be approved by the Major Professor and the department offering the course before the student may \\n\\n• \\n\\nenroll. \\nEnroll during the regular enrollment period. \\n \\n\\n• \\n\\n \\n\\nIdeally a student should begin designing the independent study course with the prospective faculty member one \\nsemester prior to beginning the application process.  \\n\\nInternships \\nPhD students may have the option to participate in industry internships but they are not allowed to use an \\ninternship for academic credit. \\n\\nGraduation Guidelines \\nCertification for Graduation  \\nIn order to be certified to graduate, students must verify their graduation status with the SPDC Graduate \\nSecretary. Student should then proceed with applying for graduation with the Office of The Registrar by \\ncompleting the Application for Graduation Form. If the student does not graduate during the intended semester, a \\nnew application must be submitted for the semester of intended graduation. Following is detailed information on \\nthe Final steps to complete Graduate Degree. \\n\\nCommencement Ceremony  \\nThe Graduate Advanced Degree ceremonies will be held on the Friday of finals week, 3:30 PM in the Breslin \\nCenter. Graduates and Faculty should arrive one hour in advance, allowing time to put gowns on and be properly \\nordered for the procession. Students who will graduate in fall semester will participate in the December ceremony. \\nStudents who will graduate in spring or summer semesters will participate in the ceremony held at the end of \\nspring semester. To be listed in the ceremony program students who will graduate in fall, should apply for \\ngraduation at the beginning of September and spring/ summer Graduates should apply in January.  \\n\\nStudent Responsibilities and Expectations \\nIt is the responsibility of ALL doctoral students to:  \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nLearn and adhere to University and Academic Unit rules, procedures and policies, including those outlined \\nin this handbook. The academic programs, Graduate Student Rights and Responsibilities, and The \\nAcademic Freedom for students at MSU are all available at the Graduate School Website. \\nSelect a Major Professor and form a Guidance Committee that meets University and school requirements. \\nThese committee members should remain informed of the students’ academic progress throughout the \\nlength of their program. \\n\\n•  After consultation with the Major Professor a completed academic progress report/annual evaluation \\n\\nshould be submitted to the Graduate Secretary at the end of each spring semester.  \\nFollow disciplinary and scholarly codes of ethics in course work, research, and professional activities \\nfound online at MSU Student Rights and Responsibilities. \\n\\n10 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0c• \\n\\n• \\n\\nFollow high ethical standards in accordance with University and federal guidelines in collecting and \\nmaintaining data, including seeking regulatory approval for research before any research project begins; \\nProvide the school with copies of research related documents (such as permits, approvals, grant \\nproposals, research proposals) within the prescribed deadlines. \\n\\nAcademic Standards \\nGrades \\nThe student must earn a grade of 2.0 or higher in each course in the approved PhD degree plan. Any course in the \\napproved PhD degree plan for which the grade earned falls below 2.0 must be repeated.  \\n\\nCumulative Grade-Point Average  \\nThe student must maintain a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.0 in the courses listed in the approved \\nPhD degree plan.  \\n\\nAnnual Evaluation \\nGraduate students receive an annual evaluation of their academic progress, performance, and professional \\npotential. The Evaluation Form should be completed when the Major Professor meets with the graduate student at \\nleast once a year prior to the start of fall semester to review the student’s progress concerning his or her research \\nor creative activity as well as plans for work in the coming year (GSRR 2.4.8). A letter/written report on the results \\nof this review will be signed by the Major Professor and the graduate student. This report will be filed with the \\nMajor Professor and a copy filed in the student’s academic file together with any response the student may have \\nto the report of the Guidance Committee.  \\n\\nProbation Status \\n A student is placed on probation if the student’s cumulative grade-point average for the courses in the approved \\nPhD degree plan is below 3.0. \\n\\nAcademic Records \\nEach student will have an academic file on record containing submitted application materials, grade reports, \\nacademic program of study materials, and copies of official letters from the school and faculty. Students have the \\nright to challenge the accuracy of academic files. This challenge, correction or inaccuracy is addressed by the \\nstudent writing a letter that is to be placed in his or her academic file. Students are allowed to examine their file by \\nmaking an appointment with the Graduate Secretary. If a student is an employee of MSU, a separate employment \\nfile will be maintained by the employing office/program/department. \\n\\nRetention in and Dismissal from the Program \\nShould a student’s cumulative grade-point average fall below 3.0 in the approved PhD degree plan, the student will \\nbe placed on probationary status in the doctoral degree program for one additional semester. If at the end of the \\nadditional semester the student’s cumulative grade-point average is 3.0 or higher, the student will be placed on \\nfull graduate status for the doctoral degree program. If at the end of the additional semester the student’s \\ncumulative grade-point average is still below a 3.0, the student will be dismissed from the program. \\n\\nResidency Requirements \\nOne year of residence on the campus after first enrollment for doctoral degree credit is required to permit the \\nstudent to work with and under the direction of the faculty, and to engage in independent and cooperative \\nresearch utilizing university facilities. A year of residence will be made up of two consecutive semesters, involving \\nthe completion of at least six credits of graduate work each semester. \\n\\n \\n\\n11 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cTime for Completion of Degree \\nIt is vital that students make adequate progress in their graduate programs. Lack of satisfactory progress toward \\nthe degree may jeopardize the student’s funding status and other graduate student benefits, and it may lead to \\ndismissal. The Major Professor will conduct an annual review and inform the student of his or her level of progress. \\n\\nThe following time limits have been set by the University: \\n\\nThe time limit for completion of the requirements for the PhD degree is eight years from the date of \\nenrollment in the student’s first course in the doctoral degree program. \\nThe PhD comprehensive examination must be taken within five years of initial acceptance to the program, \\nand will expire after three years if there has been no progress toward the degree. \\n\\n•  All remaining requirements for the PhD degree must be completed within eight years, from the time \\n\\nwhen a student begins the first class at MSU as a PhD student in SPDC. \\n\\nApplications for extensions of periods of time toward the degree must be submitted by the school for approval by \\nthe Dean of the College and the Dean of the Graduate School. \\n\\nGrief Absence Policy \\nFor all PhD students, it is the responsibility of the student to: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\nContact their Major Professor and faculty of the course(s) in which they’re currently enrolled, requesting \\nthe need for a grief absence in a timely manner, but no later than one week from the student’s initial \\nknowledge of the situation. \\nProvide appropriate verification for the grief absence as specified by the Major Professor and faculty. \\nComplete all missed work as determined in consultation with the Major Professor and faculty. \\n\\n \\nIt is the responsibility of the Major Professor to:  \\n\\n•  Determine with the student the allowable periods of absence – it is expected that some bereavement \\n\\nprocesses may be more extensive than others depending on the individual circumstances. \\n\\n•  Receive verification of the authenticity of a grief absence request upon the students return. \\n•  Make reasonable accommodations so that the student is not penalized due to a verified grief. \\n\\n \\nIf employed as a Graduate Research or Teaching Assistant, the student must also notify their employer as soon as \\ncircumstances permit. Both employer and student will swiftly communicate to determine how the student’s \\nresponsibilities will be covered during their absence. The graduate assistant shall have the right to return to the \\nassistantship, within the original terms of the appointment, at such time as he or she is able to reassume the duties \\nof the position.  Graduate Teaching Assistants (TAs) should refer to the bereavement policy in the MSU GEU CBU \\nArticle 18. Students who believe their rights under this policy have been violated should contact the University \\nOmbudsperson.  \\n\\nCourse Waiver \\nStudents requesting course waivers must compile suitable documentation concerning the course proposed as a \\nsubstitute for the course to be waived. Suitable documentation may include but is not limited to: course syllabi, \\nexaminations, term papers, bibliographies, textbooks, reading lists, and lecture notes. A lack of suitable \\ndocumentation may result in a denied request. Once documentation is compiled, students will request written \\npermissions from their Guidance Committee and from the instructor of the course to be waived. After completing \\nthe preceding steps, students must submit all materials to their Major Professor. \\n\\n \\n\\n12 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cPolices Regarding Integrity and Safety in Research \\nIntegrity in Research and Creative Activities \\nThe conduct of research and creative activities by faculty, staff, and students is central to the mission of Michigan \\nState University “Mission Statement” approved by the Board of Trustees on April 18, 2008, and is an institutional \\npriority. Faculty, staff, and students work in a rich and competitive environment for the common purpose of \\nlearning, creating new knowledge, and disseminating information and ideas for the benefit of their peers and the \\ngeneral public. The stature and reputation of MSU as a research University are based upon the commitment of its \\nfaculty, staff, and students to excel in scholarly and creative activities at the highest standards of professional \\nintegrity. As a partner in scholarly endeavors, MSU is committed to creating an environment that promotes ethical \\nconduct and integrity in research and creative activities. \\n\\nInnovative ideas and advances in research and creative activities have the potential to generate professional and \\npublic recognition, and in some instances, commercial interest and financial gain. In rare cases, such benefits may \\nbecome motivating factors to violate professional ethics. Pressures to publish, to obtain research grants, or to \\ncomplete academic requirements also may lead to an erosion of professional integrity. \\n\\nBreaches in professional ethics range from questionable research practices to misconduct (MSU Faculty handbook, \\nchapter VI, “Research and Creative Endeavor—Procedures Concerning Allegations of Misconduct in Research and \\nCreative Activities”). The primary responsibility for adhering to professional standards lies with the individual \\nscholar. It is, however, also the responsibility of advisors and of the disciplinary community at large. Passive \\nacceptance of improper practices lowers inhibitions to violate professional ethics. Students should also refer to \\nMSU Graduate School’s “Guidelines for Integrity in Research and Creative Activities.” Integrity in research and \\ncreative activities are based not only on sound disciplinary practice but also on a commitment to basic personal \\nvalues such as fairness, equity, honesty, and respect. These guidelines are intended to promote high professional \\nstandards by everyone—faculty, staff, and students alike. \\n\\nKey Principles \\nIntegrity in research and creative activities embodies a range of practices that include:  \\n\\nConfidentiality in peer review; \\n\\n•  Honesty in proposing, performing, and reporting research; \\n•  Recognition of prior work; \\n• \\n•  Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest; \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n•  Adherence to fair and open relationships between senior scholars and their coworkers. \\n\\nCompliance with institutional and sponsor requirements; \\nProtection of human subjects and humane care of animals in the conduct of research; \\nCollegiality in scholarly interactions and sharing of resources; \\n\\n \\n\\nStudents are encouraged to read the complete text of “Integrity in Research and Creative Activities” which is \\navailable at the Graduate School website. \\n\\nEnvironmental Health & Safety (EHS) \\nThe use of hazardous materials in research, teaching, or outreach activities are subject to State and Federal Laws \\nand guidelines. The Vice President for research and graduate studies has been assigned responsibility to see that \\nappropriate practices are followed where hazardous materials are involved, to maintain a safe environment for \\ncampus personnel, to protect the surrounding community, and to assure that MSU meets its obligations under the \\nLaw. \\n\\n \\n\\n13 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cOversight of activities involving hazardous substances is provided by EHS. EHS is assisted by faculty committees in \\nthe area of radiation safety, chemical safety, and biological safety. The radiation safety committee has \\nresponsibility and authority under Federal Law for specific actions. \\n\\nThe EHS provides live and online training classes throughout the year to educate the employees and students of \\nMichigan State University on safe work practices. Completion of these courses by MSU personnel ensures that the \\nUniversity is fulfilling Local, State and Federal regulations in radiation, chemical, biological, hazardous waste, and \\nenvironmental safety. For more information about courses available, contact the EHS at (517) 355-0153. \\n\\nHuman Subjects Research \\nA student whose research involves human subjects must receive approval for their project from the Human \\nResearch Protection Program (HRPP) prior to initiating data collection for their Master’s Thesis, Pre-Dissertation \\nResearch, or Doctoral Dissertation. HRPP is an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Federal and University \\nregulations require that all research projects involving human subjects be reviewed and approved by an IRB before \\ninitiation. Under the regulations, research is defined as a formal investigation designed to develop or contribute to \\ngeneral knowledge. A human subject of research is an individual (1) from whom an investigator obtains data by \\ninteraction or intervention or (2) about whom the researcher obtains confidential information.  Anyone who \\nconducts a study that requires IRB approval must meet the training requirements for human subjects’ research \\nprotection before submitting an IRB application.  For training and education, please visit the HRPP website. \\n\\nDepending upon the level of risk to subjects in the protocol, HRPP assigns the student’s application to one of three \\nreview categories (exempt from full review, expedited review, and full review) and sends it to one, two or five \\nreviewers, respectively. If the reviewer(s) is satisfied that the rights and welfare of the human subjects are \\nadequately protected, he or she approves it. However, if the reviewer has concerns, the reviewer returns written \\ncomments to the HRPP office for transmission to the investigator. The investigator must then send a response to \\neach comment, in writing, to HRPP which will forward it to the reviewer(s). If the proposal is either an exempt or \\nexpedited proposal, an approval letter can be issued as soon as the reviewer(s) approves. When a proposal \\nreceives full (five member sub-committee) review, an approval letter is issued after the proposal is discussed and \\napproved by vote of the full committee at its monthly meeting. More information can be found online at the MSU \\nHuman Research Home Page. \\n\\nCopies of the HRPP application form and the official notification of HRPP approval must be kept in the student’s \\nacademic file maintained by the school’s Graduate Secretary and in the files maintained by the student’s Major \\nProfessor. The student also should keep copies in his or her own personal files. Failure to satisfy the University \\nstandards and HRPP regulations is considered grounds for dismissal from the program. A copy of the approval \\nmust be included as an appendix in the Thesis/Dissertation. \\n\\nMichigan State University Guidelines on Authorship \\nAdopted by the University Research Council on January 15, 1998, is available online at Vice President for Research \\nand Graduate Studies. \\n\\nAuthorship  \\nA person claiming authorship of a scholarly publication must have met the following criteria:  \\n\\nSubstantial participation in conception and design of the study, or in analysis and interpretation of data. \\nSubstantial participation in the drafting of the manuscript or in the substantive editing of the manuscript. \\nFinal approval of the version of the manuscript to be published. \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n•  Ability to explain and defend the study in public or scholarly settings. \\n\\n \\nNote: This criteria follows closely with those recommended by several professional associations. See especially the \\nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Annals of Internal Medicine 1988; 108: 258-65.)  \\n\\n \\n\\n14 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cAcknowledgment  \\nContributions that do not justify authorship should be acknowledged separately in the notes to the manuscript. \\nThese may include general supervision of a research group, assistance in obtaining funding, or technical support.  \\n\\n\"Honorary Authorship\"  \\nA claim of authorship by, or assignment of authorship to, persons who may have been associated in some way with \\na study but do not meet the full criteria in item one may constitute an unethical research practice.  \\n\\nGraduate Student Authorship  \\n\"Faculty should be especially aware of their responsibility to safeguard the rights of graduate students to publish \\nthe results of their research.\" (MSU Research Handbook, 1985, p. 16, section 4.3.1.)  \\n\\nSenior Author and Order of Authorship \\nThe senior author is generally defined as the person who leads a study and makes a major contribution to the \\nwork. All the authors at the outset of a project should establish senior authorship, preferably in a written \\nmemorandum of understanding. This memorandum of understanding should reference the authors’ agreement to \\nabide by their departments’ policy on authorship or the University default policy on authorship. At the outset of \\nthe study the senior author should discuss the outline of work and a tentative order of authorship with the study \\nparticipants. As projects proceed, agreements regarding authorship may need to be changed. It is the \\nresponsibility of the senior author to assure that the contributions of study participants are properly recognized.  \\n\\nDisputes over Authorship  \\nDisagreements over authorship, e.g. who has a right to be an author or the order of authorship, should be resolved \\nby the senior author in collegial consultation with the other authors. When this process cannot reach resolution, \\nthe senior author should arrange with his or her chairperson for arbitration by a knowledgeable and disinterested \\nthird party acceptable to all the authors. If the authors cannot agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator, then the \\nVice President for research and graduate studies shall appoint an arbitrator. During the arbitration process all the \\nauthors are expected to refrain from unilateral actions that may damage the authorship interests and rights of the \\nother authors.  \\n\\nAccountability \\nEvery author listed on a publication is presumed to have approved the final version of the manuscript. Each author \\nis responsible for the integrity of the research being reported.  \\n\\nPlagiarism \\nThe word plagiarism is derived from the Latin “plagiarist,” an abductor, and plagiary, to steal. The expropriation of \\nanother author’s text, and the presentation of it as one’s own, constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism, in turn, \\nconstitutes misconduct in scholarship under University policies and procedures. Plagiarism in scholarly projects \\nshould be reported to one’s Chairperson, Dean, or the University Research Integrity Officer (American Historical \\nAssociation, Statements on Standards, 1993, p. 13).  \\n\\nDistribution  \\nThis policy should be widely distributed, especially to each new faculty, graduate student and research staff \\nmember in academic units. \\n\\nIn many disciplines the content of one or more chapters of a Thesis/Dissertation comes directly from papers \\nalready published, often with multiple authors in addition to the author of the Thesis/Dissertation. In this context, \\ngraduate program faculty and Thesis/Dissertation committees and their chairs are urged to consider the \\nappropriateness of including a chapter in a Thesis/Dissertation that is a multi-authored published paper not \\nwritten by the author of record of the Thesis/Dissertation. If this is deemed appropriate, that practice must be \\n\\n \\n\\n15 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cdescribed in the graduate handbook. Similarly, if not seen as an acceptable practice, that position must be part of \\nthe definition of what is acceptable or not as a Thesis/Dissertation by the department/program/school. \\n\\nStudent Conduct and Conflict Resolution \\nStudent Conduct \\nThe University expects student conduct and behavior to reflect qualities of good citizenship. The out-of-classroom \\nactivities of Michigan State University students should reflect favorably upon the institution and should indicate \\nthe personal integrity of the individual. See Spartan Life: student handbook and resource guide for specific policies, \\nordinances and regulations that define some of the relevant University expectations. Students planning to use the \\nHuman Ecology Building after normal building hours must sign a code of conduct agreement available at the SPDC \\nschool office, Room 101 Human Ecology. \\n\\nConflict Resolution \\nConflicts involving a graduate student may be handled informally, or at the request of a party or parties, formally. \\nStudent’s rights and responsibilities, including grievance procedures, are detailed in the document: Student Rights \\nand Responsibilities. Procedures more specifically designed for graduate students are to be found in the \\nPublication Graduate Student Rights and Responsibilities available in the Graduate School Office in Chittenden Hall, \\n2nd Floor. It can also be downloaded from The Graduate School Website.  \\n\\nGrievance procedures outlined in these documents shall be followed and the College Advisory Council shall be \\nresponsible for the interpretation and execution of these procedures in the College. Students also have access to \\nthe University Ombudsperson for help with conflict resolution. A template and additional information on grievance \\nprocedures and resources available to students may be found online at the Office of the University Ombudsperson. \\n\\nOther Resources \\nStudy Abroad/ Travel Abroad \\nStudy Abroad programs are designed to be of benefit to students of all disciplines. In some SPDC programs \\nstudents can fulfill certain course requirements with Study Abroad credits; this fosters completion of the degree \\nprogram while gaining valuable, overseas experience. THE SPDC offers a variety of Study Abroad options.  \\nFor additional information contact:  \\nMSU Office of Study Abroad  \\nInternational Center \\n427 N. Shaw Lane, Room 109 \\nEast Lansing, MI 48824-1035 \\nPhone: (517) 353-8920 \\nStudy Abroad Website \\n \\nGrad Plan \\nAll PhD students are required to use GradPlan to track their degree progress and committee approvals. GradPlan is \\nthe only way to process final degree certification for PhD students. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n16 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cGraduate Assistantships & Work-Related Polices \\nGraduate assistantship (GA) is a generic term referring to financial support of graduate students that results in a \\nstipend and compensation and for which performance of defined duties is expected. Specific graduate assistant \\nappointments are made in one of three categories: research assistants, teaching assistants represented by the \\nGraduate Employees Union, and teaching assistants not represented by the MSU - Graduate Employees Union \\nCollective Bargaining Agreement. \\n\\nGraduate assistants are enrolled students whose primary association with MSU is directed toward advance degree \\ncompletion. Satisfactory progress toward earning a degree is a condition of maintaining the assistantship.  \\n\\nGraduate assistants are covered under MSU policies, including those regarding laboratory and campus safety, Drug \\nand Alcohol-Free Workplace, policy on Religious Observance, Procedures for Handling Allegations of Misconduct in \\nScholarship, MSU Anti-discrimination Policy, and the policies on Sexual Harassment and Conflict of Interest in \\nEducational Responsibilities Resulting from Consensual Amorous or Sexual Relationships. \\n\\nSelection of Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants \\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistants are appointed on a quarter-time, half-time, or three-quarter-time basis \\nare selected based on students’ qualifications, background, and research or teaching needs of faculty and the \\nschool. Faculty members review application folders and make recommendations to the school’s Director/Associate \\nDirector who makes the final appointment.  Most assistantships available in SPDC are related to research grants.  \\nStudents are encouraged to be in contact with faculty performing the type of research in which they would like to \\nparticipate, so they will be informed when opportunities arise. \\n\\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistantships \\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistantship support for students is determined on an individual basis \\ndepending upon recommendations, availability of funds, fellowship and scholarship support, and academic record. \\nAssistantships are reviewed annually by the Associate Director of the school and may be renewed if satisfactory \\nprogress is being made and funds are available. Assistantship support will be limited to four years for PhD \\nstudents. To request an extension of assistantship support, students may petition the Director/Associate Director \\nof the school with an accompanying letter from the Major Professor. \\n\\nIf you have an assistantship, you are required to enroll for a minimum of 3 credits at the PhD level during the \\nsemester in which they hold the assistantship. Once you complete your comprehensive exams, the following \\nsemesters you need to only be enrolled for a minimum of 1 credit. (This information is important in reading this \\ndocument.) \\n\\nExpectations \\nGraduate Teaching Assistants (TAs) play a vital role in the educational mission of MSU. Disciplinary knowledge and \\ninstructional skills are key requisites for being a successful teacher, but TAs are also expected to conform to ethical \\nand professional standards described in the MSU code of teaching responsibility. TAs must treat students with \\nrespect, deal with conflict fairly and promote a classroom atmosphere that encourages free and meaningful \\nexchange of ideas. Teaching Assistants (TAs) are subject to collective bargaining agreement with the Graduate \\nEmployees Union (GEU).  Contract terms are determined by negotiation between the University and the union.  \\nTeaching assistants will be provided information about the GEU and their membership options when they are first \\nappointed, and annually thereafter. \\n\\nInternational students whose first language is not English are required to pass the SPEAK test offered by MSU’s \\nEnglish Language Center (ELC) and achieve a score of 50 or better before they can be assigned teaching work that \\ninvolves oral communication with undergraduate students.  If a student does not achieve a score of 50 or better, \\nthey may enroll in English 097 (the TA Speaking and Listening class) and subsequently achieve a score of 50 or \\nhigher on the ITA Oral Interview (ITAOI).  The ITAOI is given by the ELC. \\n\\n \\n\\n17 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cGraduate Research Assistants (RAs) at Michigan State University play a vital role in the research and outreach \\nmissions of MSU. Disciplinary knowledge and research/laboratory skills are key requisites for conducting research, \\nbut RAs are also expected to conform to ethical and professional standards described in the MSU faculty handbook \\nsection IV: Research and Creative Endeavors. This section includes information on working with animal and human \\nsubjects, radiation, chemical, and biological safety, and adherence to federal guidelines on data generation, \\nmanagement and control. Sections of the academic freedom report for MSU students and the graduate student \\nRights and Responsibilities document also contain valuable information.  Research Assistants are not represented \\nby the GEU. \\n\\nNormal workload, averaged over the entire period of the appointment is: \\n\\n10 hours per week for a quarter-time stipend; \\n20 hours per week for a half-time stipend; \\n30 hours per week for a three-quarter-time stipend. \\n\\n \\nPeriods of Employment \\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistants Employment are as follows: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n \\n\\nFall semester: August 16 - December 31; \\nSpring semester: January 1 - May 15; \\nSummer session: May 16 - August 15. \\n\\nStipends are compensation for completion of the entire body of work associated with a TA appointment, which \\nincludes through the submission of grades when that dates falls outside the employment period.  \\n\\nResponsibilities \\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistants are responsible for understanding the weekly workload expectations \\nduring the entire period of their appointments. This includes work assigned and the time frame within which the \\nwork must be completed, essential duties and responsibilities, work conditions and vacation opportunities, if any.  \\n\\nAppointed Levels \\nLevel I \\nStudents with less than one year of experience as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant or a full support \\nfellow. They conduct research, perform administrative tasks or other supervised duties such as reading and grading \\npapers.  \\nLevel II \\nStudents with a master’s degree or equivalent and/or one year of experience as a Graduate Research and Teaching \\nAssistant or a full support fellow in the School of Planning, Design and Construction or in a department/unit \\nconsidered relevant by the Director of the school. They conduct research, grade papers, or perform administrative \\ntasks with moderate supervision. Advancement from Level I to Level II is usually routine. The advancement is \\naccompanied by an increase in stipend at least to the minimum of the Level II range established by the University. \\nLevel III \\nSuccessful completion of doctoral comprehensive exams, as defined by the School of Planning, Design and \\nConstruction in which the student is enrolled, and six semesters of experience as a Graduate Research and \\nTeaching Assistant or a full support fellow in the School of Planning, Design and Construction or in a \\ndepartment/unit considered relevant by the Director of the school. The definition of equivalent experience is left \\nto the discretion of the school Director, but it is expected that only experience in research-oriented or teaching-\\noriented assignments will count toward the six semesters of experience as a Graduate Research and Teaching \\nAssistant or full support fellow. (Consistent with current practice, ¼ time and ¾ time appointments count the same \\nas ½ time appointments, and summer semesters count the same as fall and spring semesters.)  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n18 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cMandatory Training on Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct \\nAll TAs and RAs must complete the online training about the Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Policy. \\nTo access the training, login to the Regulatory Training.  \\n\\n Click \"Register,\" \"Complete Registration\" and then \"Launch\" to begin the Relationship Violence and Sexual \\nMisconduct (RVSM) Policy - faculty, staff training. (If it indicates that you have already registered, use \"In Progress \\nTraining\", then \"Launch.\"). You will want to reserve approximately 30 minutes to complete all assignments. If you \\nneed assistance, contact the Helpdesk at train@ora.msu.edu or call (517) 884-4600.  \\n\\nEvaluation  \\nGraduate Teaching Assistants (TAs) are evaluated at the end of each semester by the faculty on record for the \\ncourse to which the TA has been assigned. Graduate Research Assistants (RAs) are evaluated by the faculty \\nmember who hires the graduate student. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants are given specific \\nassignments by their Faculty supervisor for the semester for which the student is being funded. The faculty \\nsupervisor evaluates the student’s performance based on assignments given at the beginning of the semester. \\n\\nTermination \\nGraduate Research and Teaching Assistants can be terminated if: \\n\\nThe student does not maintain an overall 3.0 GPA (or higher if set by concentration). \\nThe student is not making satisfactory progress toward his or her degree. \\n\\n• \\n• \\n•  Work performance is determined to be inferior. \\n• \\n\\nFunding is no longer available. \\n\\n \\nHealth Coverage \\nMichigan State University offers Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants health insurance coverage. ‘Student \\nonly’ coverage is automatically provided at no cost to the students. Michigan State University will provide a full \\ntwelve month coverage for assistantship appointments of at least nine months. Students may also enroll a legal \\nspouse, or other eligible individual (OEI), and/or children. Questions regarding enrollment, premium payment and \\ncoverage should be directed to the Aetna Student Health, (800) 859-8452. Questions or issues that cannot be \\nresolved with Aetna Student Health may be directed to the MSU Benefits office at 1407 South Harrison Road, \\nRoom 140, Nisbet Building, or call (517) 353-4434 extension 170 or 144. \\n\\nRight to Work \\nThe payment of union dues and fees is now consistent with the Michigan Rights to Work legislation. Nothing in the \\napplication of Michigan Right to Works Laws impact the daily terms and conditions of employment of TA’s. Union \\nmembership is voluntary; meeting the definition of a TA under the GEU contract is independent of union \\nmembership. One can be a TA covered by the contact and enjoy all the rights and responsibilities of the agreement \\nbut not be a member of the union. Union membership is not tied to the employment relationship and is a private \\nmatter between the employee and the union.  \\n\\nLeave Time \\nA graduate assistant unable to fulfill the duties of his/her appointment because of illness, injury, or pregnancy shall \\nnotify the Associate Director of the School as soon as circumstances permit.  The graduate assistant shall have the \\nright to return to the assistantship, within the original terms of the appointment, at such time as he/she is able to \\nresume the duties of the position. \\n\\nArticle 18 now provides for possible medical disputes where TA’s may not be able to perform their employment \\nresponsibilities due to physical or mental conditions. In addition, adoptions and parental leave time provides for \\npay during the first work week of applicable leave. The language on jury duty has been refined with regard to \\npayment for lost time and reporting back to work after jury duty.  \\n\\n \\n\\n19 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cAdditional Opportunities \\nInternships \\nThe school believes that there is great advantage to our graduate students to seek additional professional \\nopportunities. Internships for academic credit are allowed for students enrolled in the Urban & Regional Planning \\nprogram. Students registered for the masters in Construction Management, and the Masters in Environmental \\nDesign may not use an internship for academic credit.  \\n\\nCareer Fairs \\nConstruction Management holds a career fair during fall semesters.  Urban Planning holds a speed networking \\nevent during fall semesters.  Interior Design and Landscape Architecture hold career fairs during spring semesters.   \\n\\nTravel \\nAll travel by graduate students for academic or research project purposes requires prior approval through \\nsubmission and signing of a Travel Authorization form.  Unapproved travel is not covered by University insurance. \\nRules regarding travel can be found at the MSU Travel Office website.  Completed Travel Authorization forms \\nshould be completed with assistance from Pat Daughenbaugh in room 101 Human Ecology. \\n \\nStudents traveling internationally for MSU-related work (professional conferences, research data collection, or \\nother academic business) must consult with Pat Daughenbaugh to be entered into the Travelers Abroad Database \\n(even if they are not being reimbursed for travel).  Registration in the MSU Travelers Database allows the \\nUniversity to share important health and safety information pre-departure, and to provide emergency services if \\nnecessary. \\n\\nFunding Opportunities \\nTravel and Research Funding \\nReimbursement for research-related travel expenses should be discussed with the student’s major professor \\nbefore any travel expenses are incurred.   \\n\\nIf you are presenting your research at a professional conference, you may apply for a Travel Funding fellowship \\nthrough the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.  There is a limit of ~$400-600 approved during duration \\nof a student’s graduate program. \\n\\nIf need financial assistance with your research experience, such as data collection, short courses, attending a \\nworkshop for learning new techniques or ideas, you may apply for Research Enhancement funding through the \\nOffice of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies and administered by the Graduate School. \\n\\nIf you are confused about what funding to apply for, please contact the Graduate Secretary and she will help you \\nthrough the process. \\n\\nScholarships and Fellowships \\nThe School of Planning, Design, and Construction offers various competitive scholarships/fellowships for students, \\nwhich encompass a range of different topics and requirements, including study abroad, financial need, leadership, \\nand underrepresented students in a particular major. \\n \\nScholarships require a completed application submitted before the due date every spring semester.  Awards are \\ngood only for the following school year.  Students are expected to use the SPDC website to find the appropriate \\napplication and to watch for deadlines.  \\n\\nInternational students are taxed on fellowship funds and other awards that are above and beyond tuition and \\nfees.  More information on fellowships can be found at the Graduate School’s website. \\n\\n \\n\\n20 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cOther Financial Aid Resources \\nStudents are encouraged to be proactive in searching for funding opportunities.  Not all opportunities are \\npresented in this document. \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nThe Graduate School maintains a website dedicated to funding opportunities for graduate students.   \\nThe Office of Financial Aid \\nThe Council of Graduate Students (COGS) offers short-term interest-free loans \\n\\nDepartmental Facilities \\nMailboxes, Addresses, and E-Mail \\nThe School of Planning, Design, and Construction maintains a Graduate Student listserv which is used to send \\nnotices to graduate students by email.  Official correspondence from MSU will be sent to your MSU email address \\nso it is suggested that you check this email on a regular basis. \\n\\nAll Graduate Students are provided with an on-campus mailbox in room 111 Human Ecology.  These mailboxes are \\nfor departmental correspondence.  Personal correspondence should be directed to the student’s home address.  It \\nis the student’s responsibility to check their mailbox. \\n\\nResearch and Office Space \\nThe School of Planning, Design, and Construction provides graduate students with a work/lounge space in Human \\nEcology room 405.  It is the students’ responsibility to keep this room clean.  Drawers are available for students to \\nstore their materials in while not in use.  Drawers must be kept locked while not in use.  Students must provide \\ntheir own locks.  SPDC is not responsible for any missing possessions from unlocked storage drawers. Students may \\nchoose their own drawer from any unassigned/unlocked drawers available, but must inform Janelle Curtis which \\ndrawer they are using. \\n \\nKeys to the Grad lounge/office are available from Janelle Curtis in 101 Human Ecology. \\n\\n24/7 Access \\nAccess to the Human Ecology building is available for students involved in studio, design, and research production \\ncourses, or employed on a graduate assistantship.  Instructors will provide a list of names of those approved to \\nhave 24/7 access due to course enrollment.  To be granted 24/7 access, students must sign a Code of Conduct \\nform and turn it in to Janelle Curtis in 101 Human Ecology.  You will use your MSU ID card to access the building \\noutside normal building hours (excluding football Saturdays). \\n\\nComputer Labs \\nGraduate students can use the computers in HE 105, 106, or 309 whenever the rooms are not being used for a \\nclass or other scheduled activities.  Students are expected to clean up after themselves and not to cause any \\ndamage to the equipment. \\n\\nCopies \\nGraduate students are not allowed to use the department copy machines.  Graduate Assistants who require use of \\ncopy machines for their research activities should obtain a copy code from their supervising professor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n21 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cUniversity Resources \\n \\n\\nThe Graduate School \\nThe Graduate School offers many resources for graduate students in a variety of areas including academic, career, \\nfunding, and student life.

An understanding of the issues concerning the conduct of research in an increasingly complex world \\nhas become critical in successfully navigating the research landscape. To help prepare Michigan State University \\ngraduate students for their future scholarly work, a plan for providing the foundation of responsible conduct has \\nbeen developed in coordination with the Graduate School, the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies \\nOffice, and college associate deans for graduate education. The plan is predicated on the principles that a basic \\nunderstanding of issues is necessary through didactic training and a periodic reinforcement of the principles \\nthrough discussion. It is the belief that this plan will provide a foundation for all graduate students as well as others \\npursuing a career in research and will offer the basic information to meet most, if not all, federal agency granting \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nThe plan below represents the minimum university-level and School requirements  \\n \\nThe Graduate School RCR Workshop series may be used to help fulfill both the annual refresher and discussion-\\nbased training requirements.  \\n \\n*Students who are supported by NSF, NIH, or USDA grants may be required to complete additional specific \\ntraining; they must meet the timeline and content requirements of training for that grant.  \\n \\n*Students engaged in research involving human subjects or animal use must complete the Michigan State \\nUniversity training modules for those subjects before submitting IRB or IACUC approvals.

Exceptions can be made with the approval of all committee members; however, you should \\nplan your work with respect for faculty appointments. Often they are involved in field research, \\nStudy Abroad programs, or otherwise away from the University during the time outside of their \\nappointments. Most often this is during the summer; however, some faculty have non-traditional \\nschedules. Be sure to find out appointments and schedules of your Guidance Committee \\nmembers. \\n\\n27 | P a g e  \\n\\n• \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cEnd of Third Semester \\n\\n•  Meet with your Major Professor to discuss procedures for and scope of your comprehensive program \\n\\nstatement and the comprehensive examination. \\n\\nFourth Semester - Comprehensive Examination  \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nPrepare and submit your comprehensive program statement to your Major Professor.

When submitting an electronic Thesis/Dissertation to ProQuest, a student now has the option to open the \\ndocument to searches using Google, Google Scholar, and Google Books. The option to block such searches \\ncontinues to be available. The target date for the FINAL APPROVAL of an electronic Thesis/Dissertation to the \\nGraduate School for graduating the semester of that submission is FIVE working days prior to the first day of \\nclasses for the next semester (see future target dates below). Be aware that a submission via ProQuest does not \\nmean that the document has been ACCEPTED. The review process is interactive and final approval can take \\nanywhere from a few hours to weeks, depending upon the extent of the necessary revisions and how diligent the \\nauthor is when making the necessary revisions. \\n\\n \\n\\n29 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0cElectronic Submission’s Approval Target Dates \\nThe ETD Deadline Dates can be found at The Graduate School.

Only students who have applied for graduation will have access to the \\nsurvey. The survey asks questions about educational experiences in MSU graduate programs, as well as about \\nimmediate professional plans. The Graduate School uses data from this survey when reviewing graduate programs \\nand to guide decisions about services and initiatives for graduate students. The identity of all respondents will be \\nkept confidential and only aggregate (group) information will be made available to faculty and administrators. The \\nstudents will receive an e-mail message from the dean of the graduate school with a link to the survey. However, \\nstudents do not need to wait for that e-mail message to complete the survey after applying for graduation. It takes \\nabout 5-10 minutes to complete the online survey. Instructions for completing the survey are available online from \\nThe Graduate School ETD. \\n\\nInstructions for Students: \\n\\n•  Doctoral students should access the following website for Graduate School Exit Survey. \\n• \\n• \\n\\nEnter your MSU NetID (Login Name) and password. \\nComplete all items on the survey- when finished, click submit. \\n\\no \\n\\nIf you cannot open this survey, please email exitsurvey@grd.msu.edu and include your name, \\nstudent ID #, degree level (PhD, MA/MS) and semester of graduation. You will be notified when \\nyou are able to complete the survey. \\n\\nComplete all final forms/ questionnaires required by the Graduate School. \\nPay final fees. \\nPrepare for commencement; see guidelines and checklists provided by the University. \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 | P a g e  \\n\\n\\x0c'"
